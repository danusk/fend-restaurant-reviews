## Restaurant Review Website

A responsive, mobile-ready, offline first web application for restaurant reviews.

### Project Overview

Incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
